# Development Notes - PHASE 1 COMPLETE ✅

## Phase 1 Requirements - COMPLETED
- ✅ **Camera Sources**: Multi-camera simulation with test feeds implemented
- ✅ **YOLOv8 Model**: Fire detection backend with asyncio processing
- ✅ **Alerts**: SQLite logging with professional notifications UI
- ✅ **GUI**: Professional Tauri command center (fire safety themed)
- ✅ **Branding**: "SENTINEL Fire Command Center" with sentinelfire.org domain
- ✅ **Test Data**: Simulation system ready for future dataset integration

## Architecture Implementation
- ✅ **Tauri Desktop App**: Professional fire safety command center interface
- ✅ **Python Backend**: YOLOv8 detection engine with asyncio coordination
- ✅ **SQLite Database**: Alert management with P1/P2/P4 priority levels
- ✅ **YAML Configuration**: Hot-reload threshold system (95%/85%/70%)
- ✅ **Simulation System**: Multi-camera feed simulation for development/demo
- ✅ **Offline Operation**: Complete functionality without internet dependency

## UI Implementation - Fire Safety Command Center
- ✅ **Professional Design**: Dark command center theme with fire safety colors
- ✅ **Navigation Tabs**: Command Center, Surveillance Grid, Incident Management, Analytics, Settings, System Health
- ✅ **Real-time Dashboard**: Live activity feed, system metrics, alert management
- ✅ **TailwindCSS v3**: Custom fire safety color palette (emergency/warning/safety/fire themes)
- ✅ **Responsive UI**: Proper event handling, reduced animation intensity, window controls

## Technical Fixes Applied
- ✅ **TailwindCSS Compatibility**: Rolled back from v4 to v3.4.17 for proper class generation
- ✅ **Button Responsiveness**: Enhanced event delegation with prevent double-clicks
- ✅ **Animation Optimization**: Reduced pulsing intensity for professional appearance
- ✅ **Window Controls**: Added minimize/maximize/close buttons to Tauri window

## Next Phase Priorities
- **Real RTSP Integration**: Replace simulation with actual camera feeds
- **Fire Model Training**: Custom YOLOv8 training with fire-specific datasets
- **Network Systems**: Redundancy, failover, and connectivity monitoring
- **Production Packaging**: Installer, deployment scripts, field testing protocols
