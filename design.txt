 Visual Identity & Branding

  - Prominent logo design: Square logo with gradient background (red to orange/yellow) containing a white square center
  - Brand name: "Sentinel" prominently displayed with large, bold typography
  - Color scheme: Red-to-yellow gradient as primary brand element, complemented by sophisticated gray palette

  Typography & Font System

  - Primary font: Geist font family (modern, clean sans-serif)
  - Font features: Advanced typography with font-feature-settings for enhanced readability
  - Hierarchy: Clear type scale from 5xl-7xl for headings down to small utility text
  - Text balance: Strategic use of text-balance utility for better line breaks

  Color Palette & Design Tokens

  - Extended gray scale: 11-step gray palette (50-950) for sophisticated monochromatic design
  - Semantic colors: Success (green), warning (yellow), error (red), accent (blue)
  - Fire theme colors: Primary use of error/warning gradients to represent fire detection theme

  Layout & Spacing System

  - Container system: section-container utility with max-width and responsive padding
  - Section spacing: Consistent py-20 lg:py-32 pattern for vertical rhythm
  - Grid layouts: Responsive grid systems (1-3 columns) with proper gap spacing

  Interactive Elements & Animations

  - Micro-interactions: Hover scale effects (1.02), button press animations
  - Framer Motion: Sophisticated entrance animations with staggered delays
  - Custom animations: Float, glow, shimmer effects for visual interest
  - Progress indicators: Animated progress bars and step-by-step processes

  Component Design Patterns

  - Metric cards: Hover-lift cards with shadow transitions and scale effects
  - Button system: Primary (dark) and secondary (light) variants with consistent styling
  - Terminal/code blocks: Dark theme code previews with syntax highlighting
  - Glass morphism: Backdrop blur effects for header and overlays

  Advanced UI Features

  - Live demo section: Interactive fire detection simulation with real-time progress
  - Performance dashboard: Dark-themed monitoring interface with live data visualization
  - Camera feed simulation: Realistic forest scene with animated fire effects
  - Detection workflow: Step-by-step process visualization with progress tracking

  Accessibility & Performance

  - Reduced motion support: Respects user preferences for reduced animations
  - Focus management: Custom focus ring styles and keyboard navigation
  - Semantic structure: Proper heading hierarchy and landmark elements
  - Performance optimizations: Will-change properties and optimized animations

  Unique Design Characteristics

  1. Fire theme integration: Gradient colors and animations that reflect the fire detection purpose
  2. Technical aesthetic: Balance of enterprise software look with modern web design
  3. Live simulation: Interactive demo that actually demonstrates the product functionality
  4. Monochromatic sophistication: Heavy use of grays with strategic color accents
  5. Terminal integration: Code blocks and terminal styling that appeals to developer audience
  6. Metric-focused design: Performance numbers prominently displayed throughout

  This design system would translate well to a desktop application with its clean, professional aesthetic, clear information hierarchy, and
  thoughtful use of animations to guide user attention.
