# TODO - What You Need to Do to Make Sentinel Work

## 🔥 Critical Actions Required for Production

### 1. Collect Fire Detection Training Data 📸 **URGENT**

**What I Need:** Fire and smoke image datasets to train the custom YOLOv8 model

**Your Tasks:**
- [ ] **Collect 1000+ fire images** from various sources:
  - Controlled fire training exercises
  - Wildfire photos (public datasets)
  - Indoor fire simulations
  - Industrial fire incidents
- [ ] **Collect 1000+ smoke images**:
  - Early-stage fire smoke
  - Various lighting conditions
  - Different backgrounds
- [ ] **Collect 2000+ non-fire images** for negative samples:
  - Normal indoor/outdoor scenes
  - Steam, fog, dust (common false positives)
  - Bright lights, reflections
  - Moving objects

**Format:** JPG/PNG images, any resolution (system will resize)
**Organize like this:**
```
training_data/
├── fire/          # Images with fire/flames
├── smoke/         # Images with smoke
└── normal/        # Images with no fire/smoke
```

### 2. Get Real Camera Access 📹 **URGENT**

**What I Need:** Access to actual RTSP cameras for testing

**Your Tasks:**
- [ ] **Provide RTSP camera URLs** in this format:
  ```
  rtsp://username:password@192.168.1.100:554/stream1
  ```
- [ ] **Camera requirements:**
  - Must support RTSP protocol
  - 1080p or higher resolution
  - Minimum 15 FPS
  - Fixed mounting (not PTZ during detection)
- [ ] **Network access:**
  - Cameras accessible from server
  - Stable network connection
  - Port 554 open for RTSP
- [ ] **Test cameras:** Verify I can connect to each camera URL

### 3. Configure Alert Destinations 📱 **HIGH PRIORITY**

**What I Need:** Real contact information for alerts

**Your Tasks:**
- [ ] **Provide email addresses** for fire alerts:
  ```
  Primary: chief@firestation.com
  Secondary: duty@firestation.com
  ```
- [ ] **Provide phone numbers** for SMS alerts:
  ```
  Primary: +1-555-123-4567
  Secondary: +1-555-987-6543
  ```
- [ ] **Set up Twilio account** (for SMS):
  - Create account at twilio.com
  - Get Account SID and Auth Token
  - Purchase a phone number
  - Provide credentials to me
- [ ] **Email server details:**
  - SMTP server (e.g., smtp.gmail.com)
  - Username/password for sending emails
  - Port (usually 587 for TLS)

### 4. Provide System Hardware 💻 **HIGH PRIORITY**

**What I Need:** Proper hardware to run the system

**Your Tasks:**
- [ ] **Minimum server specs:**
  - 16GB RAM (32GB preferred)
  - NVIDIA RTX 3060 or better GPU
  - 500GB SSD storage
  - Intel i5-8500 or AMD Ryzen 5 3600
  - Stable internet connection
- [ ] **Network redundancy:**
  - Primary: Ethernet connection
  - Backup: Cellular modem/hotspot
- [ ] **Power backup:**
  - UPS with 1-2 hour runtime
  - Automatic shutdown capability

### 5. Set Detection Thresholds 📊 **MEDIUM PRIORITY**

**What I Need:** Your preferences for alert sensitivity

**Your Tasks:**
- [ ] **Decide alert levels:**
  - P1 (Immediate): How confident before auto-dispatch? (95%?)
  - P2 (Review): Human verification threshold? (85%?)
  - P4 (Log): Data collection threshold? (70%?)
- [ ] **Test period:**
  - Run system for 1 week in "log only" mode
  - Review false positives/negatives
  - Adjust thresholds based on your environment

### 6. Ground Truth Data for Testing 📋 **MEDIUM PRIORITY**

**What I Need:** Known fire/no-fire scenarios for calibration

**Your Tasks:**
- [ ] **Document test scenarios:**
  - Controlled fire drills with exact times
  - False positive triggers (steam, dust, lights)
  - Normal operations baseline
- [ ] **Create ground truth log:**
  ```csv
  timestamp,camera_id,fire_present,notes
  2024-01-15 14:30:00,cam_1,true,Training drill - small fire
  2024-01-15 14:35:00,cam_1,false,Fire extinguished
  ```

### 7. Integration Requirements 🔗 **LOW PRIORITY**

**What I Need:** Integration details for your existing systems

**Your Tasks:**
- [ ] **Fire panel integration** (if needed):
  - Dry contact relay requirements
  - Voltage/current specifications
  - Wiring diagrams
- [ ] **CAD system integration** (if needed):
  - API endpoints
  - Data format requirements
  - Authentication credentials
- [ ] **Network security:**
  - Firewall rules needed
  - VPN access requirements
  - Security policies

### 8. Create Standard Operating Procedures 📝 **MEDIUM PRIORITY**

**What I Need:** Your organization's response procedures

**Your Tasks:**
- [ ] **Define response procedures:**
  - Who gets P1 alerts?
  - Who verifies P2 alerts?
  - Response time requirements
  - Escalation procedures
- [ ] **Training plan:**
  - Who needs system training?
  - How often to practice?
  - Documentation requirements

## ⚠️ Critical Notes

- **Training data quality matters more than quantity** - Clear, varied images
- **Camera positioning is crucial** - Good coverage, stable mounting
- **Test everything** - Don't go live without thorough testing
- **This is supplementary** - Keep your existing fire detection systems
- **Safety first** - When in doubt, err on the side of more alerts
