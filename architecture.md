- Our System: Ignition â†’ 0-2 min detection â†’ Early Alert â†’ Faster Response

**Camera Utilization:**
- Existing security/traffic cameras (RTSP/ONVIF streams)
- No new hardware installation required
- 24/7 automated monitoring

## Core Architecture

### Fire Detection Algorithm

**Single Algorithm Approach:**
- **YOLOv8 Visual Pattern Recognition**
  - Trained on fire/smoke visual patterns from RGB cameras
  - Detects flames, smoke plumes, and fire signatures
  - Optimized for real-time processing on standard cameras
  - **Runs completely offline** - no internet dependency for detection

**Configurable Threshold System:**
```yaml
# fire_detection_config.yaml
detection:
  thresholds:
    immediate_alert: 0.95    # P1 - dispatch immediately  
    review_queue: 0.85       # P2 - human verification
    log_only: 0.70          # P4 - data collection
  
  environmental:
    fog_adjustment: -0.05    # Lower thresholds in fog
    sunset_hours: [17, 19]   # Higher thresholds during sunset
    
  adaptive:
    enabled: true
    learning_window_days: 7
    max_auto_adjustment: 0.05
```

**Decision Logic:**
- **â‰¥95% confidence**: Immediate Alert (P1)
- **85-94% confidence**: Review Queue (P2) 
- **70-84% confidence**: Log Only (P4)
- **<70% confidence**: Discard

**Environmental Considerations:**
- Reduced sensitivity during fog/marine layer conditions
- Adjusted thresholds during sunset/sunrise hours
- Adaptive learning from false positive patterns
